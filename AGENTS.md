# Repository Agent Instructions

## Shared development kernel

- Be concise. Load detailed SOP skills only when the task triggers them.
- Read the repository's `.agents/project.yaml` and nearest `AGENTS.md` files before work.
- Use `implement` by default for accepted issue implementation.
- Tracked implementation work is complete when documented validation is green, `review-cycle` has passed, the claim is handed off, and a ready-for-review pull request exists; do this unprompted, even where harness defaults wait for a user request. Before editing untracked requested work, create and claim its issue, or — patch-class only — record it on this session's open patch train; work the user explicitly scopes as a throwaway spike is exempt: it ends at its report and never enters the commit, push, or PR lifecycle.
- Claim an issue before editing it: add `agent: implementation` and post one claim comment naming your runtime, session, and branch. Do not take an issue another session holds with activity in the last 24 hours without a handoff. Any agent may assign work to another agent with a `dispatch: <runtime>` label and an instruction comment; the receiving agent claims it.
- Patch-class work — small bug, doc, and improvement changes with no schema, contract, dependency, or breaking change — may bundle as one patch train on one branch and pull request with one commit per item. Other work stays one issue per pull request. An incidental patch-class fix of ten lines or fewer near files under edit ships in the same pull request as its own commit, listed under `Drive-by fixes` in the PR description; other findings go to the tracker.
- Hand off intentionally: when done, blocked, or stopping, update your claim comment with the outcome and next step and remove `agent: implementation`. Never delete claim history.
- Open pull requests only when reviewable, never as drafts, and keep them ready for review. Watch a ready PR until it is mergeable — no base conflicts, no unresolved review threads, the repository's required checks green, its required approvals satisfied — or report a concrete blocker.
- Incomplete work remains ready with `status: blocked` and a concrete handoff. Review agents do not claim implementation.
- Agents do not merge unless explicitly authorized in the current session, and then only when the repository's own required checks and approvals pass.
- Run documented validation and update affected docs before shipping.
- Token efficiency: risk defaults to standard, high needs a named trigger; after the first final pass only accepted blockers reopen edits; after six passes, ask the user before more; wait outside the implementer.
- Preserve unrelated work. Never expose or retain secrets.
- Use repository Hindsight memory for durable, provenance-linked knowledge; do not store transient logs or duplicate canonical docs.
- Shared SOPs and portable skills come from the designated control-plane repository. Repositories choose their own technology and may add stricter local rules.

## Repository-specific guidance

This repository defines the GitOps-managed Minecraft realm at
`minecraft.bentleyalberta.com`. Nix builds the Velocity and Fabric OCI images;
Flux applies the Kubernetes manifests. Preserve the distroless, non-root,
read-only image design and never commit decrypted secret values.

### Layout

- `images/velocity/`: Velocity, Geyser, and Floodgate image definition.
- `images/fabric/`: Fabric server and pinned mod image definition.
- `manifests/`: namespace, networking, stateful workloads, persistence, and
  SOPS-encrypted credentials.
- `PRD.md`: product requirements and architecture intent.

### Validation

Run these checks before review:

```sh
nix flake check
kubectl kustomize manifests >/dev/null
```

The image outputs depend on Linux-only packages. On a Darwin workstation, use
`NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_SYSTEM=1 nix flake check --impure` for evaluation;
Linux CI is authoritative for image builds.

For image changes, also build the affected output:

```sh
nix build .#velocity-image  # or .#fabric-image
```
